title: dt06_calculate_shelfwide_racmoD.qmd
abstract: |
  The purpose of this notebook is to create shelfwide daily RACMO variables.
  This notebook is a similar premise to dt02, but for daily data (so slower).
  
  The data from this notebook is needed in dt07, which in turn is used by an04 
  to create figure 4 of the GRL manuscript, and by an07 to create supplementary 
  figures 5, 6 & 7.
  
  The same 27 shelves are used (see dt00 for their definition), and only pixels
  that are at least 50% ice shelf (according to MEaSURES Version 2, Mouginot et
  al. 2017) are included.
  
  The daily RACMO data was shared by co-author Christiaan van Dalum; it is from 
  the same model run as the monthly dataset (doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5512076), 
  but saved as daily means / sums.
  
  Format the startDate and endDate params as "Mth-dd" (e.g. "Dec-24").
  
  Different standard R functions can be used as func; for example, "mean" 
  returns the average snowmelt of the pixels on a shelf; "sd" would 
  return the standard deviation of the snowmelt values across the shelf pixels.
  
params:
  racmoVar:  "snowmelt"
  startDate: "Oct-28"
  endDate:   "Mar-04"
  func:      "mean"

# Data Prep & Set-Up
```{r}
## Run set-up scripts ----------------------------------------------------------
source("R/su01_set_up.R")
```

## Read in raw RACMO and subset based on the param dates
```{r}
# Read in based on the dates
racmoD <- polarcm::read_racmoD(params$racmoVar) |> 
  polarcm::subset_racmoD_by_summer(summers = 1980:2018) |>
  terrapin::subset_by_monthDay(periods = c(params$startDate, params$endDate))
```

## Prealloate & quick check of the dates here 
```{r}
# Preallocate with dates; each shelf will get a new column for the values
shelfwide  <- terrapin::get_date_info(racmoD)
funVarName <- paste(params$func, params$racmoVar, sep = "_") # to subset output

print(shelfwide)
```

# Shelfwide values -------------------------------------------------------------
This can easily take >2-5 minutes.
```{r}
# Loop through each shelf
start <- domR::start_timer(params$racmoVar)
for (ii in pToken$shelves) {
  iiShelf <- polarcm::get_shelf_outline(ii)
  iiData <- polarcm::calc_fun_in_space(x = racmoD,
                                       extent = iiShelf,
                                       minArea = 0.5,
                                       FUN = params$func)
  shelfwide[[ii]] <- iiData[[funVarName]]  # subset output & ignore the dates
  domR::cat_progress(which(pToken$shelves == ii), length(pToken$shelves))
}
domR::print_line(" ")
end <- domR::end_timer(start, params$racmoVar)
```

## Handle units & precision
```{r}
# Grab columns with our data in; handles
colIndex <- pToken$shelves # [pToken$shelves %in% colnames(shelfwide)]

# We round based on the variation in the dataset
prec <- shelfwide[ ,colIndex] |> unlist() |>
  sd() |> signif(3) |> 
  domR::count_decimal_places()

# Round
shelfwide[ , colIndex] <- shelfwide[ , colIndex] |> round(prec)

# Convert units
if (params$racmoVar %in% pToken$varMass) {
    # from kg m-2 s-1 to kg m-2 day-1
    shelfwide[, colIndex] <- shelfwide[, colIndex] * (60 * 60 * 24)
} else if (params$racmoVar %in% pToken$varTemperature) {
    # from Kelvin to Celsius
    shelfwide[, colIndex] <- shelfwide[, colIndex] - 273.15
}
```

# Save =========================================================================
## Metadata
```{r}
blurb <- paste("These values are daily shelfwide", params$racmoVar, "averages.",
               "Mass values are means of the daily totals (in kg per sq. metre)",
               "across the respective shelf (i.e. the units are kg m-2 day-1).",
               "Energy fluxes are means of the daily total energy received for",
               "each sq. metre (W m-2 day-1). Temperatures are in K. Winds are",
               "in m s-1. The shelf boundaries are from MEaSURES Version 2",
               "(Mouginot et al., 2017), and only pixels which are at least",
               "50% shelf are included. Daily climate data is from RACMO2.3p3",
               "and have been shared by co-author Christiaan van Dalum. See",
               "his 2022 TC paper for an overview of the RACMO setup.")
